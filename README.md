# Table Task

The main component enables users to toggle the visibility of specific columns through a menu, offering a flexible and personalized view of the data. The table is populated with information fetched from an external JSON file. The individual rows of the table are rendered by the TableBody component, which allows users to customize the displayed fields such as title, category, price, date, author, status, and actions. The project leverages third-party icons from the "react-icons" library for visual elements and employs Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean styling. Noteworthy functionalities include a status dropdown for each item, allowing users to set the status as "Publish" or "Draft," and an "Edit" button in the actions column.
